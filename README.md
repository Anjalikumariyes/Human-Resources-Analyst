## Project Goals
Workforce Overview: Provide executives with a real-time snapshot of the workforce (headcount, turnover, diversity, engagement).

Attrition Analysis: Identify high-risk departments, reasons for termination, and turnover trends to improve retention.

Performance & Engagement: Analyze how employee engagement influences performance, and identify outliers (high engagement/low performance or vice versa).

Diversity & Inclusion: Visualize gender, race, and age distribution to ensure inclusivity and compliance.

Compensation Insights: Highlight salary distribution and pay equity across departments and genders.

## Key Deliverables

Tableau HR Dashboard with the following components:

KPI Summary: Termination Rate %, Avg Salary, Avg Engagement, Avg Satisfaction, Avg Absences.

Diversity & Inclusion: Gender distribution, Race & Ethnicity breakdown, Age groups.

Attrition Trends: Termination by Department, Terminations over Time.

Performance & Engagement: Distribution of performance scores, Engagement vs Performance scatterplot.

Compensation Analysis: Avg Salary by Dept (split by gender).

## Data Preparation:

Cleaned and structured HR dataset (CSV).

Calculated fields in Tableau (Attrition Rate, Median Salary, etc).
